# Interactive picture similar color extractor
##introduction
A simple interactive program created with MATLAB gui to extract similar color pixel regions in an image.
##Algorithm
Extracting the pixel color program is very simple. I learned the gui in one afternoon and wrote this program. The difficulty in programming is the parameter passing, because there is no regular usage such as return.
